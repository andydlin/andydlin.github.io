                    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                    <p>I'm from San Francisco, a place where opportunities are waiting right around the corner. No one told me to become a designer or developer, I was lucky enough to be exposed to it. I formed a connection right away and took advantage of what we had: the internet.</p>
                    <p>It's been 3 years since I first began learning how to design and code, mostly through Google searches and online courses. Being able to learn so much on my own really proves that anything is possible with passion and drive.</p>
                    <p>Since my work revolves around a computer almost 24/7, I try to stay active. I've picked up on photography (all images on this website were taken by me), try to exercise at least four times a week, and I enjoy spending time with my loved ones. Seeing the people around me happy is what makes me happy and keeps me motivated in doing what I do best: helping others. </p>

                    <h3>PRINCIPLES</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5><span>01</span> USERS COME FIRST</h5>
                            <p>I put your users and customers first, so should you. Creating something that "looks pretty" should be followed by "will this help my users' experience?"</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5><span>02</span> COMMUNICATION IS KEY</h5>
                            <p>I communicate with an open mind, but stand strong with my beliefs. I believe being open minded is important.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5><span>03</span> STAY FOCUSED</h5>
                            <p>I limit myself to the number of projects at once, this way I can give each project its respected time and focus.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5><span>04</span> KEEP LEARNING</h5>
                            <p>I don't know everything. There's always something new to learn, whether it's related to your area of expertise or related to the people you're working with. Always ask questions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5><span>05</span> TAKE A BREAK</h5>
                            <p>Whether you're a writer, musician, photographer or trainer, you need to take a step back and reflect on what you've been doing. I do this to make sure I am staying on track. Coming back to a project with a fresh mind is often beneficial as well.</p>
